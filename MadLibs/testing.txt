One day on the great red ball lived a very strange offspring. 
Their name was chair. This person was very happy. 
Their mother found out that they had been run all day long. 
This was very disappointing to their mother. One day the mom woman decided she had enough of her offspring.
She took her husband MR Jeffery in hand and flew toward her offspring. "You little blue sad candle !!!!" 
The mother shouted at her child with a worry voice. "You have the same value as box. YOUR WORSE THEN EVEN Samantha." 
The offspring knew what was next. Their mother and father rode off into the sunset with the milk and a yellow match. 
A tear rolled down the offsprings face. All the sat and sang they had done with them had meant nothing.
An orphan now, they failed to go to harvard. THE END.
