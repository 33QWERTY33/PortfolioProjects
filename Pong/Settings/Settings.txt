    - ball speed is the amount of pixels the ball will move each iteration (options are 5 and 10)

    - paddle speeds are the speed that the player bars will move each iteration (options are 5 and 10)

    - ball color is the color the ball will be (options include: 'white', 'red', 'yellow', 'blue', etc.)

    - background color is the color the background will be (options include: 'white', 'red', 'yellow', 'blue', etc.)

    - player 1 win message and player 2 win message is the message that either player will receive if they win

    - background music is the music that will play during the game, can be set to False to turn music off (options are: 'Regular', 'Stupid', 'Epic')

WARNING:
	- Do NOT delete any characters in this text file besides the settings, this includes the weird arrow thingies and the names of the settings
	- Also audio doesn't work, turns out playing stuff in the background is really difficult to do without threading or something

CONTROLS:
	You control the left paddle with the w and s keys
