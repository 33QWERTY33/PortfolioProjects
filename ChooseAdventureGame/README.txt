This is a text based choose your own adventure game. 

There is save functionality implemented through simple text files. 

There are config files that work with a few predefined keys and values which can be generated by using the generateConfBlueprint.py file in the etc folder.

Customizable features include text color, text print style, text print speed, and header text content.

There is a mini language used to direct the choose your own adventure. The $ symbol is used to denote control information such as the ID of some text, the input edges to the text and the output edges to the text (for mapping purposes). Under the control information the text information is wrapped in square brackets i.e. [This is the first line]. A newline character is placed by setting a ; character at the end of the line inside of the square brackets after the desired text. Finally a * character followed by the first initial of a color is used to change the color of certain text dynamically while being printed.

The idea was to have some text content, then map certain choices such as turning left or right to the user input of A or B which would direct the user to a different text outcome.

I haven't actually made a fully functioning "adventure" besides a small one with no real content just to test functionality.


*** My favorite part about this program is the cprint function which implements colored printing to the console using just ANSII codes and no external libraries.

*** I was just beginning to work with larger codebases, I am not happy with the structure of this or the naming conventions
